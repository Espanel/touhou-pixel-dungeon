scenes.supporterscene.title=Seriousness for Fumofumo
scenes.supporterscene.intro=Fumofumo is a Touhou Project plush sold by Gift, and is very popular thanks to its distinctive eyes. Fumofumo was originally sold at Gift. That time it was very easy to get. However, unlike when it was sold at Gift, it is currently being sold at Amiami, so it is very difficult to get Fumofumo now. Unlike Gift, it cannot block bots, the server is unstable, and the supply of Fumofumo is insanely low. It is completely different from the days of Gift when fumofumo was able to buy stably.
scenes.supporterscene.patreon_msg=However, Gift continues to sell Fumofumo at Amiami. This is an act of deceiving consumers. We would be grateful that you send an email to Support-onlineshop@gift-gift.jp or below link which contains to stop selling at AmiAmi and sell at Gift again while significantly increasing the supply of Fumofumo. If you don't want Fumofumo to be ruined by a lot of bots and scalpers, please join us in sending emails. (It takes less than a minute.)
